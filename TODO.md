# TODO

1. Use drop-down lists. Maybe to allow to choose a specific convincing method. Also other input methods.
2. **DONE** Replace <input type="button"> with <button>.
3. **DONE** Respond correctly to `Enter` being pressed.
4. **DONE** Consider using 2 different pages, instead of just style manipulations.
5. **unrelevant** Then, use it to learn about `GET`, `POST` and `PUT`.
6. Consider using event listener to convince more/less using keyboard arrows.
7. **FIXED**: after tail hits max - it doesn't replace "!" with "?" and vice versa.
8. Maybe instead of adding to tail, it will first replace the second char ("!"/"?"), and only when all is the same - will add/deduct.
9. **DONE** Right now it adds to tail in a random place, but deducting the last (relevant) char.
10. Style is boring. 
11. `New Opinion` button should be styled differently than the others by it.
12. **FIXED** Text in input is weird. The input box is big, but the text is small and on it's horizontal center.
13. **FIXED** Fixed-position button `Express` is floation above input box when window height is too small.
14. **FIXED** Also, `New Opinion` button is floating over the 2 others when window width is too narrow.
15. No "Documentation" (lol).
16. Fix this `label` error that appears on devtools.
17. **BUG** Text in convinsing is flowing down instead of first using territory above. May use flexbox and flex-wrap to fix.
